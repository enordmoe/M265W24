## Outcomes for Today

* Learn about Quarto documents in RStudio

* Use Quarto to create a simple document to be pushed to a GitHub repository

* Get RStudio to talk to GitHub

## Quarto documents  {.smaller}

**Quarto** is an open source scientific and technical publishing system.

* The input file (`qmd`) can contain code chunks, text content, LaTeX mathematical formatting commands.
  - Code chunks can be R, Python, Julia and Observable JavaScript
  - Visual editor built into RStudio

. . . 


* Produces dynamic reports including text, code, tables, equations, citations, cross references, output, figures and advanced layouts.
  - Many document types: articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, books, etc.
  - Multiple output formats such as HTML, MS Word, and many more
  - Many style themes available to change the look and feel of the document

. . . 
  

* Emphasis is on sharability, reproducibility, and versatility

## Reproducibility  

Value of reproducibility: 

* Transparency of research

* Verification of code

* Longer term
    - use code/analysis for new or updated data
    - extend/modify analysis for other settings/data
