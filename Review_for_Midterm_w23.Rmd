# 3 Data Visualization

Every **ggplot2** plot has three key components:

1. data,
2. A set of aesthetic mappings between variables in the data and visual properties, and
3. At least one layer which describes how to render each observation. Layers are usually created with a geom function.

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point()
```

1. Be familiar with the following geoms and their typical aesthetic specifications:  

  * `geom_bar()`  
  * `geom_boxplot()`  
  * `geom_col()`  
  * `geom_density()`  
  * `geom_freqpoly()`  
  * `geom_histogram()`  
  * `geom_jitter()`  
  * `geom_line()`
  * `geom_point()`  
  * `geom_smooth()`  

2. Common aesthetics and their relationship to type of variable (categorical vs quantitative/continuous) :  

  * `x` and `y`  
  * `color` and `fill`  
  * `size`, `shape`, and `linetype`  

  
3. Scales and how they can be used and specified manually  

4. Stats and their connections to geoms, especially for categorical variable plots like `geom_bar()`.  

5. Position adjustments and their relationship to geoms  

6. Faceting methods and their purposes  

7. Use of `coord_flip()` and `coord_cartesian()` to control the appearance of plots.  

8. Practice on the end of section questions in R4DS.  I have a link to R4DS solutions near the top of the Moodle page but [it's also here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/). These solutions also have some very valuable insights and extensions to the text material.  



# 5 Data Transformation 

1. Be familiar with the different types of variables in R.  

2. Know the purpose and syntax of the five key **dplyr** functions:  
  * `filter()`  
  * `arrange()`  
  * `select()`  
  * `mutate()`  
  * `summarise()`  
  
3. Be able to describe the role of `group_by()` to change the scope of each function from operating on the entire dataset to operating on it group-by-group.  

4. Know how missing values work and how to use the `is.na()` function to include or remove cases with NA values.  

5. Be familiar with "helper" functions for `select()` and `summarise()`. These need not be memorized since you have them on the cheat sheets.  

6. Other commands from this section you should know about and be able to use when necessary:  

  * `distinct()`  
  * `count()`  
  * `slice()`  
  * `pull()`  
  * `top_n()`  
  
  
# Types of Questions  

1. Multiple choice: Which code chunk yields this output?  
2. What does this code do?
2. Find the error and fix it (nothing very obscure).  
3. What goes in the missing spot in the code chunk?  
4. Write a small code chunk to create the given output.
