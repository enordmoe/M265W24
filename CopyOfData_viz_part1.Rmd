# Topics for Today

* A Brief History of Visualisation

* How to construct a graph (paper and pencil)

* Introduction to the Grammar of Graphics

* Getting started with **ggplot2**

* Visualising a famous data set

* Aesthetics!

---

# Learning Outcomes for Today

* Be able to describe the main ideas of the grammar of graphics.

* Be able to construct a labeled **ggplot2** graph with 3 aesthetics.

* Be able to explain the role of aesthetics in constructing **ggplot2** graphs.

# Make a Hand-Drawn Graph

*Consider the following data

```{r, echo = FALSE}
set.seed(695)
car_sub <- mpg %>%
filter(year == 2008) %>%
  select(1:3, 7, 9) %>%
  sample_n(10)
car_sub
```

**Task:**  Make a hand-drawn graph that shows the relationship between engine displacement (`displ`) and highway mileage (`hwy`). For each point in your graph, identify  the  drivetrain (`drv`) of the vehicle. 

---

## Discussion

>*  What were the steps in your process? 

--

>*  What choices did you need to make?

--

>*  Suppose you had total sales for the model year available for each car. How could you show that on your graph?

# Introduction to ggplot2

* **ggplot2** implements the grammar of graphics 

*  Basic graphing template 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +
  other options
```

1. Begin with the `ggplot()` function  
    + Construct base coordinate system

1. Add layers 

1. Map variables to aesthetics (visual properties)  

1. Use the `+` sign to connect lines

---

# ggplot2 Example  

Why does this work?

```{r, fig.height = 2}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

... but this does not?  
```{r, fig.height = 2, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) 
  + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

# Aesthetics

We can map specific variables in the data to various features of the plot:

* Aesthetics  (`aes`)
    + shape  
    + color  
    + size  
    + alpha (transparency)  
    
* Faceting: use categorical variables to view cross sections of the data     

**Note:**  Not all aesthetics can be used with all types of graphs. More to come on this.

---

# Aesthetics summary  

* Behavior of aesthetics depends on the nature of the variable:

    + Factor and discrete quantiative variables are measured (or often counted) on a
    discrete scale or by categories

    + Continuous variable are measured on a continuous scale


| Aesthetics |             Discrete/Factor             |                Continuous               |
|:----------:|:---------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------:|
| color      |            palette of colors            |   gradient  (e.g, dark blue to light)   |
| size       |              discrete steps             | linear mapping between radius and value |
| shape      | different shape for each level/category |       shouldn't (and doesn't) work      |

---

### Aesthetics summary: Mapping vs Customization

*  Use aesthetics for mapping features of a plot to a variable   

```{r, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, size = cyl))
```

---

### Aesthetics summary: Mapping vs Customization (cont'd)  

* Define the features in the `geom` outside the `aes()` function for aesthetic 
customizations **not** mapped to a variable  

```{r, fig.height = 4.5}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
   geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy),  size = 0.5)
```
