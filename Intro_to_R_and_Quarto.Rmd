# Outcomes for Today

* Get more familiar with the RStudio IDE

* Get RStudio to talk to GitHub

* Learn about Quarto documents

* Gain awareness of available references

* Use Quarto to create a simple document to be pushed to a GitHub repository

# Git and GitHub

.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}

```
- Git is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word, on steroids

- It's not the only version control system, but it's a very popular one

- Was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005
]
.pull-right[
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/GitHub_Logo.png")
```
- GitHub is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet -- like Dropbox but much, much better

- We will use GitHub as a platform for submitting homework and collaboration on projects

## Git vs GitHub

* What's the difference?

<div style="text-align:center;">
<img src="https://devmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gitvs_Github-1a-1.jpg" alt="Image Alt Text" width="60%"/>
</div>

* We will use RStudio running Git behind the scenes to interface with GitHub

## Versioning

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lego-steps.png")
```

Note that in a real construction project, progress is not so linear. There may be work going on in several parts of the building.

## Versioning
### with human readable commit messages

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lego-steps-commit-messages.png")

## Why do we need version control?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="35%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/phd_comics_vc.gif")
```

* Document project
* Facilitate team collaboration
* Share work

# Git and GitHub tips

- Becoming Git masters is beyond the scope of the course.

- Using the RStudio server to interface with GitHub will allow us to focus on just a few commands and avoid command line complications.

# Let's talk about Quarto

---

# Quarto documents  

**Quarto** is an open source scientific and technical publishing system.

* Input (`qmd`) can contain code chunks, text content, LaTeX mathematical formatting.
  - Code chunks can be R, Python, Julia and Observable JavaScript
  - Visual editor built into RStudio
--

* Produces dynamic reports including text, code, tables, equations, citations, cross references, output, figures and advanced layouts.
  - Many document types: articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, books, etc.
  - Multiple output formats such as HTML, MS Word, and many more
  - Many style themes available to change the look and feel of the document
  
--

* Emphasis is on sharability, reproducibility, and versatility

# Reproducibility  

Value of reproducibility: 

* Transparency of research

--

* Verification of code

--

* Longer term
    - use code/analysis for new or updated data
    - extend/modify analysis for other settings/data
