# Learning Outcomes for Today

* Become comfortable with basics of R syntax and running scripts

* Become familiar with the RStudio IDE

* Creating Quarto documents

* Gain awareness of available references

* Use Quarto to create a simple document to be pushed to a GitHub repository

# Quarto documents  

**Quarto** is an open source scientific and technical publishing system.

* Input (`qmd`) can contain code chunks, text content, LaTeX mathematical formatting.
  - Code chunks can be R, Python, Julia and Observable JavaScript
  - Visual editor built into RStudio
--

* Produces dynamic reports including text, code, tables, equations, citations, cross references, output, figures and advanced layouts.
  - Many document types: articles, presentations, dashboards, websites, books, etc.
  - Multiple output formats such as HTML, MS Word, and many more
  - Many style themes available to change the look and feel of the document
  
--

* Emphasis is on sharability, reproducibility, and versatility

# Reproducibility  

Value of reproducibility: 

* Transparency of research

--

* Verification of code

--

* Longer term
    - use code/analysis for new or updated data
    - extend/modify analysis for other settings/data
