# Outline  

* Tables 

* Keys  

* Mutating Joins

* Filtering Joins  

---

# Keys

* A variable or set of variables used to connect each pair of tables are called **keys**  

* Examples of potential keys  
    + Academic records: Student ID 
    + Employee database: Social security number  
    + Medical records: Date of birth AND name
    + Roster: First and Last name
    + Public health data: Country code  
    
* Think of two or three tables that could be joined using these keys.  

---

# Key Facts  

Two main types:  

* **Primary key:** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table  

* **Foreign key:** uniquely identifies an observation in another table  
    + Could be the same variable(s) OR 
    + Could have a different name in the foreign table

* **Surrogate keys:** somtimes added when there is no primary key (an arbitrary case id or row number)

## Airline Flights Data 

Consists of 5 tables:  

* `flights`: on-time data for all flights departing NYC area in 2013

* `airlines`: contains airline code and name  

* `airports`: gives static information about each airport by 3-character code

* `planes`: gives static information about each plane by `tailnum`

* `weather`: gives dynamic hourly weather info near each NYC airport

---

## Linking Airline Flights Tables  

```{r, out.height = "50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/245292d1ea724f6c3fd8a92063dcd7bfb9758d02/5751b/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png")

## Mutating Joins  

Use a "Mutating Join" to join one table to columns from another  

* Matching values with the rows they correspond to.   

* Each type of join retains a different combination of values from the tables.  

---

## Kinds of Mutating Joins  

* Four ways to join these two tables

```{r, out.width = '75%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/tables_x_and_y.png')
```

---

## Kinds of Mutating Joins  (cont'd)

```{r, out.width = '75%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/mutating_joins.png')
```

---

## Visualizing Joins  

* Consider two simple tibbles:  

```{r, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/static/png/original-dfs.png')
```


* An excellent set of [animations](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/) have been developed by Garrick Aden-Buie to help visualize how each type of join works. 

---

## Mutating Joins: Outer Joins

* Outer joins keeps observations that appear in at least one of the tables. 

* These joins add  additional "virtual" observations to each table.   

* Missing variable information are filled in with NAs.

---

## Outer Join Examples: Full Join  

* A full join keeps all observations in x and y.
* Code example:  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
full_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

```{r, out.height = '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/full-join.gif")
```

---

### Outer Join Examples: Left Join  
* A left join keeps all observations in x.  
* Similar to using a lookup table.
* Code example:  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```


```{r, out.height = '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/left-join.gif")
```

---

### Outer Join Examples: Right Join  

* A right join keeps all observations in y.  
* Equivalent to doing a Left Join swapping x and y.  
* Code example:  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
right_join(x, y, by = "key")
```


```{r, out.height = '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/right-join.gif")
```

---


### Mutating Joins: Inner Join  

* An inner join matches pairs of observations whenever their keys are equal.
* Code example:  
```{r, eval = FALSE}
inner_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

```{r, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/inner-join.gif')
```

---




### The Perils of Duplicate Keys  

```{r, out.height = '100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/duplicate_keys.png')
```

**Note**: When you join duplicated keys, you get all possible combinations!

$\Rightarrow$  Remove duplicates with `distinct()`


---

## Filtering Joins  

Use a "Filtering Join" to filter one table against the rows of another.  
* Useful for determining which rows in a table 

    + *Have* a match (`semi_join()`)  

    + Do *not* have a match (`anti_join()`)

---

## Kinds of Filtering Joins  

```{r, out.height = '100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/filtering_joins.png')
```

---

## Kinds of Filtering Joins: Semi Join

```{r, out.height = '100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/semi-join.gif')
```

---
## Kinds of Filtering Joins: Anti Join

```{r, out.height = '100%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/project/tidyexplain/images/anti-join.gif')
```

```

## Questions for Soccer Joins  

Thought experiment: For these two tables, think about what tibble would be produced by each of the 6 joins.  Draw the tible you expect to be produced and answer the following?  

1) How many rows and columns? 

2) Which rows are included/excluded?  

3) Are NA values produced by join? Where?

4) Which columns are included/excluded?

---

## Reflection Questions

1) Compare/contrast the joins. Think of situations where you might prefer one over the other.    

2) The filtering join `semi_join()` is most similar to which of the mutating joins? Why?
