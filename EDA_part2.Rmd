# Review from Last Time

1. Compare and contrast `geom_histogram()` and `geom_freqpoly()` functions?

--

2. What is `binwidth` used for?

--

3. What is `coord_cartesian()` for?

# Graphical Methods for Exploring Relationships

* Quantitative and quantitative variable
  + Scatterplot with smoothing line
  + Conditional boxplots

* Categorical and quantitative variable
  + Boxplots
  + Faceted plots (histogram)

# Price vs Carat Weight 
Use only diamonds less than 3 carats

```{r diamond-scatter, fig.height = 4}
smaller <- filter(diamonds, carat <= 3)
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```

# Boxplot

# Boxplot

A **boxplot** is 

  * A visual depiction of the extremes,  quartiles, and outliers in a set of data
  
--

  * Especially useful for a rough comparison of the center and spread of a variable across several sub-groups.

---

# Constructing a Boxplot 

1. Draw a numerical scale appropriate for the data.

2. Draw a box stretching from 25th to 75th percentile representing the middle 50% of the data.

3. Divide the box with a line at the median.

4. Draw a line (whisker) from each quartile to the most extreme data value that is **not an outlier**.

5. Identify each outlier individually by plotting with a symbol such as an asterisk or dot.

**Note:** Use side-by-side boxes to compare sub-groups.

## Boxplot example comparing  mileage by year
### Oops, what went wrong?
```{r,fig.height=3}
library(fueleconomy)
cardata <- vehicles %>% semi_join(common)
ggplot(data = cardata, aes(x = hwy, y = year)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(y = "")
```

### Boxplot example comparing  mileage by year
#### That's better and add some color

```{r,fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = cardata, aes(x = hwy, y = factor(year), color = factor(year))) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "")
```

---
### Boxplot example comparing  mileage ascending by median mileage

```{r,fig.height=5}
ggplot(data = cardata, aes(x = hwy, y =  reorder(factor(year), -hwy, median),  color = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "")
```

---

# Outliers

* Often best identified using judgment by inspection of a visual data display.

* Use width of the box (IQR = 75th-25th percentile) to help detect outliers

* __Rule of Thumb__ suspected outliers are data values more than 1.5 IQRs beyond the quartiles

---

## Quantitative and Categorical Relationships

* Compare the distribution of a quantitative variable across groups determined by the categorical variable(s).

    + Use side-by-side boxplots for an overview.
   
    + Use comparative histograms or freqpoly to see more detail.
    
--

* Any of the statistics we use for a quantitative variable can be looked at separately for each level of a categorical variable.


---

### Using Conditional Boxplots with Quantitative Data 

* Use cut functions (`cut_interval`, `cut_width`, etc) to discretize one of the continuous variables.

```{r, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(group = cut_width(carat, 0.25, boundary = 0)))
```
