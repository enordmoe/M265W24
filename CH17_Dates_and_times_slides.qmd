## Outline

-   Factors review

-   Problems with dates and times

-   Parsing functions

-   Intervals, periods, and durations

## Factors Review {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Be careful about piping with factors. Why?

-   What is the difference between `fct_count()` and `fct_unique()`?

-   Compare and contrast `fct_infreq()` and `fct_reorder()`?

-   Income is recorded in 20 narrow categories but I want to regroup to
    have just 4 categories. What `fct_xxx()` function should I use?

-   How do you tell R to drop empty factor levels that do not occur in
    the data?

    -   How could this happen?

## Dates and Time?

# Dates and Times are Challenging!

::: incremental
-   Many formats for writing times

-   Leap years (and leap seconds!)

-   Irregular months

-   Time zones

-   Daylight savings time (when is a day not a day?)

## Those tricky dates...

```{r}
parse_date("March 21st, 1992")
parse_date("12th of Jan, 2016")
```

## Those tricky dates...

```{r}
parse_date("1942Jan03")
parse_date("July041776 0930")
```

## **lubridate** to the rescue

![](figures/data_sci_superhero.png)

## Parsing functions

**lubridate** has a series of smart functions for parsing dates that do
better than `parse_date()`:

-   Dates only:
    -   `ymd()`, `dmy()`, ...
-   Dates and times:
    -   `ymd_hms()`, `dmy_hms()`, `dmy_h()`, `ydm_h()`
-   See the Cheat Sheet and help files for more functions and details

## **lubridate** parsing functions

```{r}
mdy("March 21st, 1992")
```

. . .

```{r}
dmy("12th of Jan, 2016")
```

. . .

```{r}
ymd("1942Jan03")
```

. . .

```{r}
mdy_hm("July041776 0930")
```

## Difficult Questions about Dates and Times

### Why are these questions difficult?

-   What day is one year after January 1, 2019?

-   What day is one month after February 15, 2019 (or 2024?)?

-   What time is 60 minutes after 1:30 am on March 10, 2019?

    -   What is the last day of February?

## **lubridate** has several ways of dealing with these problems {.smaller}

-   Answers depend on the starting point

```{r}
dmy("01-Jan-2019") + years(1)
dmy("01-Jan-2019") + days(365)
```

. . .

-   Leap year gives different results

```{r}
dmy("01-Jan-2020") + years(1)
dmy("01-Jan-2020") + days(365)
```

## **lubridate** has several ways of dealing with these problems

```{r}
dmy_hm("10-Mar-2019 01:30", tz = "America/Detroit") 
dmy_hm("10-Mar-2019 01:30", tz = "America/Detroit") + minutes(60)
dmy_hm("10-Mar-2019 01:30", tz = "America/Detroit") + dminutes(60)
```

## Timespans in **lubridate** {.smaller}

-   **Periods**: track changes in clock times ignoring irregularities

    -   `minutes()`, `years()`, etc.
    -   No `months()` because they're too irregular

. . .

-   **Durations:** track the passage of physical time

    -   `dminutes()`, `dhours()`, `dweeks()`, etc.
    -    Underlying object stored in seconds

. . .

-   **Intervals**: represent specific intervals of the timeline, bounded
    by start and end date-times

. . . 

Can be very confusing $\Rightarrow$ see **lubridate** [Cheat
Sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/lubridate.pdf) for helpful examples

## Other useful functions: Rounding date-times

```{r, out.width = '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/rounding_dates.png')
```
